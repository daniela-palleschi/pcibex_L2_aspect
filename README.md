PCIbex experiment: eye-tracking VWP + binary picture selection 

L2-English speakers.

- re-record stimuli (English: DP)
- pre-test:
  - binary picture-selection task (n = 40?)
  
  
Questions

- I think some of the demo info collected is maybe relevant for the Turkish speakers, cause I guess you pay them differently?  E.g., do we need (for our purposes):
  - putting personal phone number? maybe not?
  - asking for their address and actual birthday...do we need this/is it really allowed?
    + I usually just give a drop down menu of 18-31, with '17 or younger' and '32 or older' as options, which then will end the experiment if they continue

But again, maybe this is needed because of the different population/payment?
