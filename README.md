PCIbex experiment: eye-tracking VWP + binary picture selection 

L2-English speakers.

To do:

- translate instructions to English (data_includes/main.js)
- re-record stimuli (English: DP)
- pre-test:
  - binary picture-selection task (n = 40?)
  
  
Questions (from DP)

- I think some of the demo info collected is maybe relevant for the Turkish speakers, cause I guess you pay them differently?  E.g., do we need (for our purposes):
  - putting personal phone number? maybe not?
  - asking for their address and actual birthday...do we need this/is it really allowed?
    + I usually just give a drop down menu of 18-31, with '17 or younger' and '32 or older' as options, which then will end the experiment if they continue

But again, maybe this is needed because of the different population/payment?

Consent/Participant info:

- what we do is usually just provide a link to a PDF version of our consent forms and participant info sheet (the ones with all the legal jargon), and have 'by clicking Continue you confirm that you have read and agree'. We don't ever ask for their name, DOB, address, because this is very much so then not anonymised! (even if it's not logged, they don't know that...)
- so basically I might try to consolidate the info/demographics a bit to use some of my PCIbex code to implement these changes? it'll also make the pre-experiment workload less for them. Thoughts?
